# JoyStream Skills

A public, open collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for
[JoyStream](https://joystream.ai) — reusable building blocks you can import into
your JoyStream Skills Catalog and compose into agents.

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter + a Markdown
body). The JoyStream importer scans this repo's tree and registers every directory
that has a `SKILL.md` as one skill.

## Skills

| Skill | What it does | Services |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| [`repo-activity-summary`](./repo-activity-summary/SKILL.md) | Reads merged/open PRs + notable commits across one or more repos over a window and returns a **summarized** "repo changes" digest | GitHub |
| [`project-ticket-summary`](./project-ticket-summary/SKILL.md) | Reads closed/moved/opened tickets on a GitHub Project over a window and returns a **summarized** "ticket changes" digest, with a gist of each closed ticket | GitHub |

Both skills only **read and summarize** — they return a digest and post nowhere,
so they compose with any delivery service (Discord, Slack, email) and can be
reused independently or together. Delivery is handled by the *agent* calling a
connected service, not by a skill.

## Import into JoyStream

```bash
# CLI
joystream skills repo add https://github.com/joystream-ai/joystream-skills \
  --scope selected --workspace <workspace-id>

joystream skills list        # confirm the skills landed
```

Or in the app: **Settings → Skill Repositories → Add repository**, paste this
repo's URL, and pick a visibility scope.

## How we think about skills

Skills sit in a layered model — pick the altitude that matches the value a skill adds:

```
TOOLS / SERVICES   raw ops (github.listPRs) — already generic; the agent's services
       ↑ a skill must add reusable PROCEDURE or JUDGMENT above this line
SKILLS             capability skill  → a reusable primitive (read + normalize)
                   task skill        → a reusable judgment (summarize into a digest)
       ↑
AGENT              one-off glue: which repos, which channel, what schedule
```

Guidelines for contributing a skill here:

- **Earn your place above the tools.** If a skill is just a rename of one service
  call with no added procedure or judgment, it's a tool, not a skill.
- **Generic for capabilities, specific for judgment.** Make reusable *capabilities*
  broad and parameterized; a *judgment* (like "summarize into themes") is meant to
  be opinionated — keep it as its own task skill only if more than one agent reuses it.
- **One-off logic belongs in the agent, not a skill** (target repos, `#channel`,
  cron time). Keep those out of `SKILL.md`; expose them as `Inputs`.
- **One skill per directory**, `SKILL.md` with frontmatter: `name`, `description`,
  `compatibility`, `license`, `allowed_tools`, `metadata`. Body follows the
  Purpose / Inputs / Reasoning Flow / Output / Constraints / Edge Cases / Examples
  shape used by the skills here.
